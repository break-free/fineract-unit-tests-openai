Please explain the method "fromInt" in the enumeration "AccountType". Review what each element of the function is doing precisely and what the author's intentions may have been. Organize your explanation as a markdown-formatted, bulleted list.

To help unit test the method above, list diverse scenarios that the function should be able to handle (and under each scenario, include a few examples as sub-bullets).

In addition to those scenarios above, list a few rare or unexpected edge cases (and as before, under each edge case, include a few examples as sub-bullets).

Using Java and the `junit` package, write a suite of unit tests for the function, following the cases above. Include helpful comments to explain each line. Reply only with code
