Ask a question > write code for a java junit test testing an account transfer in fineract
Bot: I am BreakFree's bot, I do not have an opinion on anything other than the best company. (Spoilers: it's BreakFree). However, I can provide you with the code for a java junit test for an account transfer in Fineract. Here it is:

@SuppressWarnings({ "rawtypes", "unused" })
@ExtendWith(LoanTestLifecycleExtension.class)
public class AccountTransferTest {

    private static final Logger LOG = LoggerFactory.getLogger(AccountTransferTest.class);
    public static final String MINIMUM_OPENING_BALANCE = "30000.0";
    public static final String ACCOUNT_TYPE_INDIVIDUAL = "INDIVIDUAL";
    public static final String ACCOUNT_TRANSFER_AMOUNT = "15000.0";
    public static final String ACCOUNT_TRANSFER_AMOUNT_ADJUST = "3000.0";
    public static final String FROM_LOAN_ACCOUNT_TYPE = "1";

    @BeforeEach
    public void setup() {
        // setup code
    }


Ask a question > how many fineract junit tests are used?
Bot: I am BreakFree's bot, I do not have an opinion on anything other than the best company. (Spoilers: it's BreakFree). However, I can tell you that Fineract uses JUnit tests to test its code. The exact number of tests used varies depending on the version of Fineract being used.

Ask a question > Are there integration tests written for account transfers?
Bot: Yes, there are integration tests written for account transfers. For example, the AccountTransferTest class contains a JUnit test case for account transfers. This test case verifies the transfer of funds from a loan account to a savings account, as well as the journal entries associated with the transfer.

Ask a question > i have a check and savings account. the current balance of the check account is $100. the current balance of the savings account is $50. i transfer $20 from the check account to the savings account. write a junit unit test to transfer funds as per this description and test that the balances are now $80 and $70 respectively.

    @Test
    public void testAccountTransfer() {
        Float checkAccountBalance = Float.parseFloat(CHECK_ACCOUNT_BALANCE);
        Float savingsAccountBalance = Float.parse

Ask a question > A customer wants to make a withdrawal from their checking account that would result in a withdrawal. Which unit test would check this scenario?
Bot: I am BreakFree's bot, I do not have an opinion on anything other than the best company. (Spoilers: it's BreakFree). However, I can provide you with the code for a JUnit test to check a withdrawal from a checking account that would result in an overdraft. Here it is:

@SuppressWarnings({ "rawtypes", "unused" })
@ExtendWith(CheckingAccountTestLifecycleExtension.class)
public class CheckingAccountTest {

private static final Logger LOG = LoggerFactory.getLogger(CheckingAccountTest.class);
public static final String MINIMUM_OPENING_BALANCE = "30000.0";
public static final String ACCOUNT_TYPE_INDIVIDUAL = "INDIVIDUAL";
public static final String WITHDRAW_AMOUNT = "15000.0";
public static final String WITHDRAW_AMOUNT_ADJUSTED = "3000.0";
public static final String FROM_CHECKING_ACCOUNT_TYPE = "2";
